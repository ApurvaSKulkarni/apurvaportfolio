<h2>My Projects</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>1. Calculator using C</b>
<p>
During my first semester of graduation, I did a project to create a versatile calculator using the C programming language. This project aimed not only to implement basic arithmetic calculations but also to incorporate advanced functionalities such as trigonometric ratios, percentage calculations, and logarithmic values. 
The primary objective of the project was to reinforce my understanding of fundamental programming concepts, particularly loops and switch cases, while simultaneously developing a practical and functional tool.
The scope of the project encompassed the development of a user-friendly calculator interface capable of performing a wide range of mathematical operations. It focused on implementing algorithms for basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, percentage calculations, and logarithmic operations.
I used a structured approach to software development, emphasizing modular programming and efficient algorithm design. Loops and switch cases were extensively employed to handle user inputs, execute calculations, and manage program flow.
I completed within the timeframe of the break of the first semester.<br>
In conclusion, the C calculator project served as a valuable learning experience, consolidating theoretical knowledge with practical application. It exemplified the importance of hands-on projects in reinforcing programming concepts and fostering skill development in software development. Moving forward, the insights gained from this project will undoubtedly inform and inspire future endeavors in the field of computer science.
